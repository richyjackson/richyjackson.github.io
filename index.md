### About me

Hi, I’m Richard Jackson. I’ve spent over a decade working with data in the banking sector, gaining experience across data analysis, engineering, migration, Power BI development, and the Snowflake Data Cloud.

This site serves as a working library of useful code snippets and techniques I’ve collected throughout my career.
