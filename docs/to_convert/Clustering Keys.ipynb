    "Clustering keys in Snowflake help optimize query performance by organizing data efficiently for faster retrieval. Unlike primary keys, which ensure uniqueness and integrity, clustering keys improve query speed by reducing unnecessary data scans, especially in large tables.\n",

    "For the NOTES table, frequently queried by NOTE_DATE, applying a clustering key on NOTE_DATE ensures that Snowflake stores and retrieves data more efficiently. This improves performance for accessing data over specific time periods.\n",

    "This reduces full table scans, leading to faster query execution and improved performance for dashboards and reporting.\n"
