### About me

Hi, I'm Richard Jackson. I've been working with data for over a decade within the banking sector. My experiences span, analysis, data engineering, data migration, PowerBI development & Snowflake data cloud.

I've put this site together as a working library of useful code snippets I have collected along the way.
